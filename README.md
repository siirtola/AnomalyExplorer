# AnomalyExplorer
JavaScript Software for Detecting Ca2+ Transient Abnormalities in Cardiomyocytes

## What is it?

The AnomalyExplorer (AE) is a HTML5-based analysis tool for calcium
cycling. It is based on the earlier Java implementation described
in

>Siirtola, H., Àvalos-Salguero, J., Penttinen, K., Aalto-Setälä̈, K., and Juhola, M. (2014). Interactive biosignal analysis and classification. In Information Visualisation (iV2014), 18th International Conference, pages 327–332. (PDF available upon request.)

Basically, AE is a one-page web application implemented mainly in JavaScript. It should run on any modern web browser, but it has been specifically tested with Google Chrome and Safari.

## Documentation

Currently, the only documentation is the [PLOS-One article](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0135806). The distribution contains example data files demonstrating the anomaly types that can be detected with AE.

## Installation

AE does not require any installation beyond copying the files and the folder structure into a new location. AE does not even require a web server as it can be run from a local copy.

## Running the software

Files include test dataset which can be uploaded to AE from “Choose files” function. Suitable control parameter settings for this test dataset are set as default but can be as well controlled by user. Immediately after the test dataset is uploaded to the software, results with the default parameter settings are shown.
